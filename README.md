# Analysis of College Football Games, 1950 to 2019

Welcome!  This is my analysis of all college football games played from 1950 to 2018, with particular focus on how accurate the Associated Press polls are at predicting the "best" team.  I also explore some basic community detection approaches to see if I can identify what conference a team plays in solely based on what teams they play.

This work is broken into three notebooks.  The [first notebook](https://redhairedcelt.github.io/college_football_analysis/CF%Scrape.html) includes the web scraper.  The second notebook has the bulk of the analysis.  The third notebook includes my initial foray into network analysis.

There are multiple different directions this work could go in.  I would be interested in determining teams that are consistently over or under ranked.  Using network analysis, we could also try to find the most intense rivalries between different teams.
